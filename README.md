# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System
This project implements a  **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies similar to a userâ€™s choice based on movie metadata such as **genres, cast, and keywords**. It leverages natural language processing and vector similarity to deliver real-time recommendations through an interactive Streamlit web app.

# ðŸ“¦ Project Overview
- Utilized the TMDB dataset, containing over 5,000 movie entries.

- Cleaned and processed data using Pandas, extracting features like genres, cast, crew, and keywords.

- Combined relevant text fields into a single composite feature for each movie.

- Applied NLTK for text preprocessing including stemming and stopword removal.

- Converted textual data into vectors using CountVectorizer.

- Calculated cosine similarity between movies to find the most relevant recommendations.

- Developed a clean and responsive interface using Streamlit to display top recommendations.

# ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

# âœ… Features
Enter any movie title and get the top 5â€“10 similar movies instantly.

Recommendations are based purely on content similarity, not on user ratings or reviews.

Real-time, fast predictions with a clean, user-friendly interface.

Easily extendable to support new datasets or different similarity measures.
