ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies similar to those a user likes, based on movie metadata such as genres, cast, and keywords. It uses natural language processing and vector-based similarity to provide real-time recommendations through an interactive Streamlit web app.

ðŸ“¦ Project Overview
Utilized the TMDB dataset, containing over 5,000 movie entries.

Cleaned and processed data using Pandas, extracting features like genres, cast, crew, and keywords.

Combined relevant text fields into a single feature for each movie.

Applied NLTK for text preprocessing (e.g., stemming, stopword removal).

Transformed text into vectors using CountVectorizer.

Calculated cosine similarity between movies to find the most similar ones.

Built a clean, responsive interface using Streamlit to display top recommendations.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy

NLTK for text processing

Scikit-learn for vectorization and similarity calculations
